Hi, I am Kush Agarwal, a 17 years old Computer Engineering Student. 

After Passing Out from 10th Grade in 2020, I  got admission in Vivekananda Education Society's Polytechnic, one of the top institutes for Diploma in Engineering. Always being a tech enthusiast, I got a great attachment to Programming and Web Development. Also I am an occasional gamer and have an interest in Game Development.

I believe "Hard Work, Will Power And Dedication - For a person with these qualities, the Sky is the Limit" - Quoted By Late Legendary Indian Sprinter Milkha Singh. I always stay dedicated to my goals in life and follow the words of my supreme inspiration. 

I am currently a Polytechnic student at VES Polytechnic focusing majorly on concepts such as "Data Structures", "Web Development", "DBMS" and many more.
